# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Here's some info on [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about). It's basically a series of coding puzzles. It's all for fun. I usually do the puzzles daily until the lore either becomes too much for me to bother with or I run into a problem you can only solve by already knowing an obscure mathematical proof.

Speaking of fun, this challenge is a blast, and it's all put together by volunteers. It's been a nice way to challenge yourself in December.

I don't normally have a ton of time to optimize, but I've tried to do the best I can with the time I set aside for doing these challenges. üòÅ
